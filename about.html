        <h2>welcome, here you will find the history of new york</h2>

<p>The first explorer to glimpse the island of Manhattan in 1524 was the navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano in the service of the French crown. The area, which he named New Angoulême, was inhabited by the Algonquian and Iroquoi</p>
 
    <p>arrival of the Dutch
    The second to explore the bay was the British Hudson in 1609, in the service of the Netherlands, which gave its name to the river.
    
    The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the area, and in 1614 they built Fort Nassau, the first European settlement in the area of ​​present-day New York.</p> 
    
    <p> 1626, Peter Minuit, governor of the Dutch West India Company, bought Manhattan Island from the Indians for $24 and created a colony he called New Amsterdam. The colony specialized in the fur trade with the Indians.</p>
    
    <p> 1674, by the Treaty of Westminster, the island of Manhattan passed from the Dutch to the English, who renamed it New York in honor of the Duke of York. With the neighboring colonies the English constituted New England.</p>
    
   <p> With the presence of the English, New York gained importance and prosperity as a trading port, and in 1754 Columbia University was founded, currently one of the most prestigious in the world.</p>
    
    <p> the 18th century, English settlers clashed numerous times with the French for control of Manhattan, wars in which the settlers managed to involve the Indian tribes in their cause.</p>
    
   <p> New York played an important role in the War of Independence of the United States, being the scene of several battles. In 1775, the revolutionaries opposed the loyalists to England and approved independence the following year.</p>
    
   <p> However, the state of New York did not ratify the federal constitution until 1788.</p>
        
    <p>Hasta 1898 la ciudad estaba formada únicamente por Manhattan a la que se unieron los distritos de Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx y Staten Island. A ello contribuyó la construcción de muchos de sus famosos puentes y el metro en 1904.</p>
